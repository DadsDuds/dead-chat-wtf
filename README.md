# discord bot which sends gifs through tenor
Discord bot that I made with the sole purpose of sending gifs by typing in a command.

If I'm being completely honest I don't remember where I stored my tenor api key since you'll need that to send gifs from tenor.

Not to mention integrate it into your bot.
